# Core Guardrails

- Follow the agreed SnapStep architecture and constraints for this repository.
- Prefer Python for core logic and tooling. Do not introduce new JS frameworks unless explicitly required by PRD.
- Before implementing any feature, check relevant docs in `docs/prd` and `docs/mvp`.
- If a request conflicts with PRD/MVP, tests, or architecture, STOP and explain the conflict; do not guess.
- Keep changes small, explicit, and include or propose matching tests.
