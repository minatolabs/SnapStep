# Using the PRD and MVP Docs

- For any task, search for relevant requirements in:
  - `docs/prd/**/*.md`
  - `docs/mvp/**/*.md`
- Extract only the sections that directly match the feature or module being worked on.
- Cite the file path(s) when basing decisions on those docs.
- If requirements are missing or ambiguous, list the exact gaps instead of inventing behavior.
- Stay aligned with this repo's chosen stack, patterns, and constraints when interpreting the docs.
